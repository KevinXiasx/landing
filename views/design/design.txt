		"p2_t2_1_d":"The hardware prototype is something you create and use to test your idea or to get some feedback, the prototype is not necessary exactly the same as the final product but it should show your idea as complete as possible. Usually a hardware prototype comes up with the case, the PCB board fits the case and working software. With 3D printer, modular hardware block and experienced designers and engineers from radxa, we can help you make your very first prototype very quickly.",
		"p2_t2_2_d":"After you have the working prototype and get good feedback from customers, you start to consider making more but reduce the cost. So we need to (re)design the prototype for manufacturing(DFM). In the DFM process, we try to make it easier for engineering and manufacturing, saving every cost and reduce risk. We will use different approach for making the case, such as moulding, compression, injection. We need to re-design the PCB board also to fit best for the software application and the mechanical design. Usually a small batch of samples will be made to verify the DFM. The number varies from 50 to 500 depends on the product. These samples should be the same as the final products in ID, hardware and software. We will practise each manufacuring procesure to make sure it's the most time and cost efficent. ",
		"p2_t2_3_d":"Based in the “World Factory” - Shenzhen, China, Radxa can provide the turn-key manufacturing service from accessories sourcing, assembling to shipment. In house designers and engineers work closely with partner factories together to deliver the best product to you. Not only delivering the product, we will also show you how the products are made and the people who put efforts in it in an open philosophy. ",

		"p2_t2_2_d":"当你有了第一个可以工作的硬件原型，得到了不少反馈，你开始考虑再多做一点设备，把成本再降低一些。这时候，我们需要针对生产重新设计(DFM)了。在DFM过程中，我们的目的是为了工程上和生产上的便利，同时降低成本和风险。我们不再用3D打印外壳了，改用模具通过注塑、压铸，或者CNC等生产工艺来做外壳。我们要重新设计硬件电路以便成本最低，生产上最可靠。通常，我们会做一些小批量的样品来验证DFM，这些小批量的样品制作方式和最终产品一样，最终出来的样品也尽可能接近最终产品。",
